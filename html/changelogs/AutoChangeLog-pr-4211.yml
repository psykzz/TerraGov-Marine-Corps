  - balance: "gave barricades 128 coverage which at minimum equates to around a 20% chance to spit beyond the barricade."
  - balance: "gave metal barricades 40 acid armor, it takes 10 acid spits to take them down with barbed wire (all other barricades have 40 acid armor too, but I didnt calculate them)"
  - balance: "made acid sprays stop at barricades and not go through them."
