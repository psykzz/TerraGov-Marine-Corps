// As standard, tank subtypes come with a primary and secondary, the primary is its big tank gun which fires explosive rounds, and its secondary is a rapid firing minigun. //
// You must manually set the offsets for your tank subtypes so that they move correctly, VV them in game to find the perfect values											//
// You can set max_passengers to something different (eg, 2 for a jeep) if you don't want loads of marines to pile in														//
// I have set the layer of this tank high so that it layers over lights. This is an issue with multi-tile sprites in byond 													//
// If you want to make a vehicle which is larger than 48x48 you'll need to make an underlay. See the APC for reference, but this makes seperate parts of the tank layer		//
